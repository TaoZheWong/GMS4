    <h1>Split MR Based on Vendor and Auto-populate Vendor Information</h1>
    <p style=" font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold">posted by Systems, 28 Feb 2014, Fri, 11:20am</p>
    <p>Previously, the MR is split according to the Product Team. The splitting logic has been enhanced as described in the following:  </p>    
    <ul>
    <li>For <b>local</b> MR, it's still split based on the Product Team. </li>
    <li>For <b>overseas</b> MR, it's now split based on the vendor. For e.g. if the MR consists of products from Product Group H13 and M23, the MR will be split into 2 MRs, as H13 and M23 are provided by different vendors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vendor contact information, i.e. Attention To, Tel, Fax, Email, will be inserted automatically based on the vendor information stored in the database. This is to prevent Product Team from having to rekey the contact information whenever a new MR is raised. </p> 
    <p>However, the Product Team is still required to make sure that the vendor information is correct before approval, by clicking the button "<b>Confirm Vendor Information</b>" at the Vendor tab. </p>
    <p>If the vendor information populated by the system is not up-to-date, you may click "<b>Delete Permanently</b>" to delete such information from the database, and key in the new vendor information at the Vendor tab. When a new MR is raised for this vendor in the future, the latest vendor information will be populated accordingly. </p>

    <p>
    Material Requisition (MR) module has been implemented for LDD and LDL since 1 Jun 2013. 
    During this period, we have received a lot of feedback from the users and we have made our best effort 
    to enhance the module by incorporating the requested features. </p>
    <p>We are now in the <b>Phase 1A</b> of the implementation, where we are still working on the 
    fine-tuning of the MR module. MR hardcopy is still applicable at this stage. 
    For all supporting documents related to the MR, kindly print these documents together with the MR, and submit to the respective parties for approval. 
    <p>
    Below is a summary of enhancements that have been implemented in the system. We will organize a briefing very soon
    to walkthrough with users on these enhancements and to gather users' feedback. Stay tuned!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Allow Salesman to raise MR for stocking purposes. </li>
    <li>Allow users to view previous purchase prices for a particular product. </li>
    <li>Email respective parties when the following events are triggered:<b><i></i></b>
    <br /><br />
    <table border="1px" width="100%" cellpadding="5px" style="">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top;">

    </table>
     <br />
    </li>
    
    <li>Remove formula for calculating <b>Order Quantity (Ord Qty)</b> to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li>Ensure reason is keyed in by the user when Selling Price is lesser than Purchase Price. </li>
    <li>Allow Product Manager to key in <b>New Product Code</b> for "zero code". The Product Code will be updated automatically after it has been created in A21. </li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>For <b>Phase 2</b>, we will be working on the online approval of the MR, MR for Red Wing shoes, 
    auto-emails to suppliers 3 days before Cargo Ready Date, auto-populate vendor information based on previously keyed in vendor information etc. These features will be available most likely in <b>October 2013</b>. </p>
    
    <p>For <b>Phase 3</b>, we will be focusing on monitoring and controlling features such as generating KPI-related reports, tracking of lost of stock, allowing Product Manager to view product sales trends when assessing MR request etc.</p>
    
    <p>In the meantime, enjoy learning and feel free to contact us if you have any good suggestions/ideas to improve this module!</p>

    <p>To assist Sales Team in budgeting for 2013, we have added a new search criterion <b>Month</b> for S31 and S31S reports
    so that the <b>YTD</b> figures will be as of the Year and Month chosen by the user. 
    
    <p>E.g. If you select 2012 for Year and 8 for Month, the YTD-12 figures will be from Jan - Aug 2012. 
    If you want to see the actual YTD for the year, simply select current month or 12 for the Month. </p>
    <p>Also, just to clarify, the column <b>2011</b> (the right most column) shows the total sales value for 2011. Hence, you can just use this number and plug it in your budget file. </p>

    These functions are directly linked to A21 system. Therefore, the information presented are real-time. 
    This will allow Sales Team to communicate with customers effectively. 
    It is also worth mentioning that the history data
